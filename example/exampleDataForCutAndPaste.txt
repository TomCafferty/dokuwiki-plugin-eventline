In his Atlantic Monthly article, Vannevar Bush describes the Memex. With this envisioned device an individual would compress and store all of their books, records, and communications, "mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility". Users would add or follow associative trails of links and notes created by that individual, or recorded by other researchers. (ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex|Wikipedia)</event>

<event start='1987' end='2004' durationEvent='true' title='Hypercard'>
An application program created for Apple Computer, that combines database capabilities with a graphical, flexible, user-modifiable interface. It is based on the concept of a "stack" of virtual "cards". Cards hold data, just as they would in a rolodex. You could build individual "cards", organized into "stacks", and linked together by clickable buttons; (ref: http://www.itworld.com/offbeat/81942/ahead-their-time-nine-technologies-came-early?page=0,3)</event>
